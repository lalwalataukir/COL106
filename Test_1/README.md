A variation of `CRF.Fn()` is provided to you as `CRF.Fn_2()`. The output of `Fn_2()` is defined to be 64 characters long in which the first 60 characters are taken directly as the first 60 characters of the input string, and the last 4 characters are the output of the `Fn()` function on the remaining input string. Example: if `x = y.concat(z)` where y is a 60 character string, then `Fn_2(x) = y.concat(Fn(z))`.


Take a look at the implementation in `CRF.java` for better understanding.


Given `Fn_2()`, implement a function `FindColl_Fn_2(String s)` that takes a 60 character string `s` as input, and will return 2 strings such that both strings have `s` as the prefix, and `Fn_2()`'s output on them is the same.


Note: You have to only submit `CRF.java` inside a zip named `EntryNumber_test1.zip` (example: `2010CS10123_test1.zip`) during your lab test.


You can create a zip by:
* Windows: Right-click on the `CRF.java` file and select `Send To -> Compressed (zipped) folder`.
* Linux/macOS: Run `zip -r 2010CS10123_test1.zip CRF.java` in the terminal inside the folder that contains your `CRF.java` file. Please make sure you change the entry number in the given command to your own entry number.
